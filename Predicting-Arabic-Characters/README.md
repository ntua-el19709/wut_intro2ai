# Predicting Arabic Characters

This was our first ever experimentation with neural networks. In this notebook we try to optimize the hyperparameters of the neural network so that it efficiently classifies hand written Arabic characters.

## Data

The data used for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/israksu/Hijja2.git).

## Implementation

Our code is in `program.ipynb`. We provide the possibility for the person who runs the notebook to set the number of layers, as well to decide the way of the hyperparameter optimization (between seperately optimizing each hyperparameter and randomly trying many different combinations and choosing the best). Full analysis for the project can be found in the file `report.pdf`.

### Note

The notebook provided does not contain the same results with the report, as it was run again.
