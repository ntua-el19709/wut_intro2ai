# Predicting Attack Packets

In this project we use 2 machine learning models, a SVM and a Decision Tree, to predict whether a packet is a DDoS attack packet or normal packet. Also we provide a comparison of the two methods.

## Data

The data used for this project can be found [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html).

## Description

Our program can be found in `code.py`. We perform hyperparameter optiization for both models, and use the data to train them. Then we show our results. Full analysis of our work can be found in `report.pdf`.
