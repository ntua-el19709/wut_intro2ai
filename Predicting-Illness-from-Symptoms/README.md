# Predicting Illness from Symptoms

This is an implementation of a Baysian Network Classifier, used to predict the illness of a patient based on the symptoms they have. The program calculates the needed probabilities from the training data, and then makes predictions for the testing data. Both training and testing data can be found in `archive.zip`. For a complete analysis of the task see `report.pdf`.
